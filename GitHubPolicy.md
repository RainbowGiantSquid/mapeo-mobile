## Overview
Digital Demcracy

## Glossary of Term
* PR = Pull Request
* Rebase
* Merge
* Version Control

## Best Practices
List of thing to do/consider as a contributor
* Follow the template
* Rebase When possible, only merge if absolutely necessary
* Make sure all translations have been completed:
* Point to develop, unless you are working on smaller pieces of a bigger project aka- sprints
* Take out all unnecessary comments. (Desribe what an unneccessary comment is). Are there any commented out code blocks? If so, erase the code instead of commenting. If

List of things that we should consider as editor
* Don't contribute, just comment
* Be timely
* Translations
* Check for any unecessary comments. This includes any code that is commented out
* Read through the code, does it make sense? If there is anything that doesn't make sense, leave a comment asking for clarification. After clarification, can you suggest another way to write the code, that makes it more human readable? If not, ask the contributor to add a comment above giving a brief explanation
* Squash and merge


## Giving Feeback
* Give constructive feedback (give example)
* Be Empathetic
* Other things (ask people)

## Template
> # Header
> Give the header a meaningful name that describes what you are doing. For Example, "New Page" is too broad of a name that doesn't specifiy what bug fix has been done. Instead use "Intro Page for App tutorial Created." Try to be descriptive, while also being concise

># Description
Describe What exactly has been done:
Give a highlevel overview of what work has been done.

If there has been a change in the UI, also describe how to view this change in the app. When necessary give step by step instructions on what steps to recreate in order to view this change.

If this is a bug fix, describe what the original bug was.

Add Screen shots of the UI
