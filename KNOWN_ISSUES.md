### Known Issues

#### Map

- If there is no offline style and the device is offline, an empty white screen shows #379
- If you open the app without an offline style, and then add a default offline
  style, the offline style may not appear until 5 minutes later on some phones
  (caching issues)
- Map "my location" blue dot sometimes appears behind observations
- Transparent circle around "my location" blue dot does not actually signify GPS
  accuracy.
- GPS pill in header does not update correctly #378

#### Observation view

- There is no explanation of what the blue "lightning bolt" means or why you cannot edit an observation #382
- Sharing an observation does not work consistently when sharing with different apps #380

#### New/Edit Observation

- There is no way to add the name of person using the
  phone to an observation
- There is no way to stop the location of a new observation updating from the
  GPS except from saving the observation (e.g. the user needs to stay in the
  same location until they save the observation for the first time)
- In the "Details" questions, there is no way to exit without clicking through every question to the end #383
- Cancelling an edit should show "discard edits" not "discard observation" #381

#### Photos

- Sometimes photos will not rotate on a device with low memory
- There is no way to delete / remove a photo from an observation #384

#### Sync

- The progress indicator jumps backwards and forwards prior to
  completion (it does seem to sync eventually, even if sync progress is not
  reliable)
- Device name is random (user cannot change it)

#### Misc

- Switching quickly between two different installations of Mapeo on the same phone can cause an error.
