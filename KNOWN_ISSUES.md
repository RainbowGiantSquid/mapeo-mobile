### Known Issues

#### Map

- Sometimes existing observations do not appear on the map
- If you open the app without an offline style, and then add a default offline
  style, the offline style may not appear until 5 minutes later on some phones
  (caching issues)
- When switching between "follow mode" (when the map follows the user
  location) and moving the map to a new location, the "blue dot" indicating the
  users location can be in the wrong place (i.e. not in the actual location from
  the GPS).

#### New/Edit Observation

- There is no way to add manual GPS coordinates
- If you close the New/Edit observation screen or
  press the back button, there is no confirmation before the edit/new
  observation is cancelled.
- There is no way to add the name of person using the
  phone to an observation
- There is no way to add additional fields to an
  observation.
- There is no way to stop the location of a new observation updating from the
  GPS except from saving the observation (e.g. the user needs to stay in the
  same location until they save the observation for the first time)

#### Edit Observation

- There is no way to delete an existing observation

#### Photos

- Sometimes photos stop working (you will see a grey box then error). You may
  need to restart the app for them to work again.
- You cannot press on the photos to see them fill the screen
- There is no way to delete / remove a photo from an observation
- Photos taken in landscape appear rotated by 90Â°

#### Sync

- The progress indicator jumps backwards and forwards prior to
  completion (it does seem to sync eventually, even if sync progress is not
  reliable)
- Device name is random (user cannot change it)

#### I8n (translations)

- Full dates are in English
- No English translation, only in Spanish

#### Misc

- It is not possible to have different versions of Mapeo open on the
  phone at the same time. You need to force-quit other versions before opening
  another
